## Advanced Analysis and Predictive Modeling: Summary of Findings

This report summarizes the results of our advanced analysis, where we engineered more detailed features and built several predictive models.

### 1. Advanced Feature Engineering & Improved Outcome Model

- **Enhanced Features**: We successfully engineered more nuanced 'form' features, including rolling averages for shots on target (for and against), progressive passes, and tackles
- **Improved Accuracy**: By incorporating these new features, our RandomForestClassifier for predicting match outcomes (Win/Draw/Loss) improved accuracy from **66.33% to 68.59%**
- **Feature Importance**: The difference in recent goal-scoring form (`form_goal_diff`) remained the most powerful predictor. However, the difference in shots on target (`form_sot_diff`) and shots on target conceded (`form_sot_conceded_diff`) also proved valuable additions

### 2. Regression Model for Total Goals

- **Approach**: We shifted from classification to regression to predict the total number of goals in a match
- **Performance**: The RandomForestRegressor achieved a **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.15**
- **Interpretation**: On average, the model's prediction for total goals was off by just over one goal, providing a solid baseline for estimating game scoring

### 3. Over/Under 2.5 Goals Classification Model

We built a binary classification model to predict the classic "Over/Under 2.5 goals" outcome with **69.53% accuracy**.

**Key Performance Insights:**
- **Under 2.5 Detection**: Highly effective at identifying low-scoring matches (96% recall)
- **Over 2.5 Precision**: When predicting high-scoring games, the model was correct 90% of the time
- **Trade-off**: The model missed a significant portion of actual "Over 2.5" games, prioritizing precision over recall for high-scoring predictions

## Conclusion

By engineering more sophisticated features, we achieved:

1. **Moderate improvement** in predicting the difficult three-way match outcome
2. **Significant success** in building effective models for betting-related outcomes
3. **Strong validation** that recent offensive and defensive form are key drivers of match dynamics

The models for total goals and Over/Under 2.5 markets show considerable promise, confirming the predictive power of team form metrics in NWSL match analysis.
